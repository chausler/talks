Abstract
Data Science is a fast growing buzzword in both industry and academia. Despite the hype, the term well reflects how a growing number of technically orientated scientists moving into traditionally less technical disciplines such as biology approach their day to day research. This body of work is an example of this approach, taking core disciplines from data science such as modelling, machine learning, statistics and data analysis and applying them to the field of neuroscience. The thesis is broken into three selfcontained manuscripts, each addressing a key neuroscientific problem in a data driven way. In the first manuscript we take inspiration from information processing in the brain and using temporal artificial neural networks and unsupervised learning, devise an approach to improve neuron based generative models. In the second manuscript we use the brain as a model and apply the approach developed in the first manuscript to the problem of dynamic representation learning in the mammalian visual cortex. In the third manuscript we use the brain as a data source and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to help understand neural representation of movement in the human basal ganglia.
